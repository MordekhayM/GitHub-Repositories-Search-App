# ASP .NET Web Application - 
# GitHub Repositories Search engine.

# Description:
This simple App, is a search engine for GitHub repositories.
The App was built in an ASP .NET Technology with MVC Design Pattern.
Since this App does not include a server-side Database (The data is being saved on the Web-Storage), it was build mostly in WEB Technologies (HTML/CSS/JS).
As asked, there was less focus on the design or responsiveness of the App, and more focus on the logic side. In this App, I used a plain BOOTSTRAP template and kept the design simple and clean.
